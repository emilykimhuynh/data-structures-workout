# Data Structures Coding Workout

List and requirements adopted from [Getting a Gig](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) and [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university).

**The goal:** Implement data structures from scratch in at least 3 languages.

**Why?** don't get dumb

TODO: add time/space complexity requirements
